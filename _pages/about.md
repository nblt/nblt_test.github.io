I am a four-year Ph.D. student at SJTU supervised by [Prof. Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/xiaolin). My research interests lie in machine learning and optimization for deep neural networks, especially for efficiency, generalization, and robustness considerations. Previous to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Automation (AI direction) from SJTU. I have a passion for developing efficient, robust, and scalable machine learning systems.
